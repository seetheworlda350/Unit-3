# Boolean Practice

## Problem 1
Finish the method problemOne so that it will ask a user for three integers and print them in ascending order and then in descending order

## Problem 2
Finish the method problemTwo so that it will ask a user for how many hours they worked (double), their hourly wage (double), and then print how much they have earned in regular pay, overtime pay, and then their total pay. Overtime pay starts if someone has worked more than 40 hours and the hourly rate for overtime is 1.5 times the base hourly rate. The wages should be formatted like money, to two decimal places.
